I’m anxious. I’m upset. I’m not exactly sure how I got to this point. I’m here. I know that I don’t want to be here. How do I move forward? What don’t I like? How do I change it? 

I guess the bigger thing is, I don’t know where I want to go. I used to know. Right now I’m just upset.

  

Step 1: Stop being upset. How do I stop being upset with myself?
