I’ve now read 3 programming books and a whole bunch of articles in the last two months. While I’ve learned some stuff. It pales in comparison to just building things. While wanting to learn how to learn things the right way first has stopped me from learning things at all.

It comes up, time and time again in from every other field, study, topic. Learn by actually doing. The guy who wrote that book and had to debug, research and architect and then teach you how how to build the application. That person, they know how to build that thing. They did it through trail and error. That’s what you lose. That’s what someone is paying you to do at the end of the day. Solve a problem. While you’re product should be built well a poorly written product is better than no product at all.

While listening to hidden brain the other night. I realized it’s not just me. It’s everyone everywhere. This is human nature. If we don’t critically think and try to do something were not doing anything.

If you’re new to programming you’re code is going to be god awful for a while. But, that’s okay. You’re building your critical thinking skills. That’s the real meat and potato’s of it.

That’s the best part of F[reeCodeCam](http://freecodecamp.com)p, the projects you build from the ground up with nothing to start with.
