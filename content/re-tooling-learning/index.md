I’ve been at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com) for the last 1.5 months. I’ve learned a bunch. But, the most I’ve learned is when I actually built something on my own. I’ve read about 3 books since I’ve been here. They’ve all been really solid. But, there’s something that they don’t really teach you. That’s the challenge and how to think about building something.

It’s kind like a drug. You feel good that you built something. But, you’re not critically thinking. All of reward with none of the sacrifice. A couple of different events got me to this point.

First: The things that I built myself. While it’s super ugly code, it’s mine. I know how that thing works through and through. Why I did what. How I did it and that one moment that brought it all together. The thing I built, it was covered in a tutorial funny enough! While that persons code was a little cleaner, I basically internalized it though learning the hard way.

Second: I’m not the only one. A fellow RC’er just did a presentation on “What am I doing?” and he had the exact same problem as me. It’s easy to have someone tell you what to do or how to do it. The person who wrote that book or tutorial now probably knows that content like the back of their hand. The way that you should.

While I’m not going to totally say, fuck books and tutorials for life. Because, I do think they have a place. I’m going to ween myself off of them a lot. Maybe an hour a day. After that it either needs to be original or if I’m referencing a tutorial It’ll be for something I’m building.

Everything is good in moderation. Including tutorials.
