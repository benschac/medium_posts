### Catalyst

 Was a nicety session that we had at our last Productioneers Weekly today (Prolific Interactive engineering wide weekly meeting). It was a reminder that the only thing that truly matters with our limited time is how we make others feel + doing meaningful, fulfilling work that we’re passionate about. Everything else is background noise. The deeply hart felt, sincere thanks I saw in that room was a wake up call for me to reevaluate where I am at this point in time.

**Work isn’t just completing a task that you’re paid to do. Our time is short. Focus on what matters regardless of the situation.**

How will people remember me when I’m gone. What will they say about me? How did I make them feel?

I hope they’ll think well of the time we shared. I hope that they’d want to keep in-touch with me or want to be friends outside of work. I hope they’d remember me as someone they could count on and who did good work.

Since I was let ago from LedgerX I’ve felt void, disconnected, and a lacking of empathy. I’ve felt numb, I’ve pulled away from the world at a time when for the first time in my life I truly started to lean in. I’ve been upset with myself but not willing to do anything about it.

For the first time in a while I’ve started to feel something again. I’d like to build on this.

### Goal

The goal of this document is to reflect and check-in on my feelings and where I see myself as a human.

As one chapter of my life is closing and a new one is opening I want to use this time to better figure out where I’m going, who I want to become and how to get there.

How can this tour of duty get me to the next position I want to be in (both personally and profressionally)? What is that position? How do I get there?

I’m forever a work in progress. This reflection is within the 6–12 month time period.

### Reflect

#### Positive 

-   **_Consistency:_** I’ve proven to myself I’m able to stick with a goal or new habit if I want to. That I have the will power if I apply myself and focus. That was the new years goal in CrossFit that I started a year and a half ago and have been true to. I consistently show up, which is something I should be proud of. The output of that consistency has altered my body for the better. It’s made me a better person because I’ve physically been able to push myself to a point where I didn’t think I could. **I should continue.**

#### Regression

-   **_Time Management:_** I lost the urgency that I once had for my time. That my time is the most important asset I have, period, point blank. It’s okay to relax and take a break. There’s a difference between that and not using it well. I need to focus on what I want to accomplish. **Having a goal post will give me direction I need to get where I want to go.**
-   **_Follow Through:_** I created a system for myself to keep myself inline and dependable. I just stopped. This is important because it effects not only me personally, but also professionally. It’s becomes a baked in pattern of my life. It becomes who I am and what others expect from me. **Focus on using this system again.**
-   **_Discipline_:** I haven’t been able to keep a healthy diet or to really focus and to commit to new things. **This is a apart of the first thing.**
-   **_Self Learning:_** Point blank stopped. It wasn’t a priority outside of just doing my job.
-   **_Caring about others_:** I have become extremely self-centered. I’ve stopped thinking of others for the most part. All that mattered was finding a job where I felt the code quality was good. With that singular goal, my relationships and quality of life have suffered. If I would have spent my free time doing it on my own, things at work would be a lot better. Try and see the world through others point of view and help them solve their problems.

### Feelings Check-In

I miss the person that I used to be. I miss the feeling of thinking that I could push myself to be just about anything. The feeling that I actually gave a shit about other people. That doing for others just felt good. With the expectation of nothing in return. I’ve become transnational.

 The feeling that I could bend reality into any direction I wanted to, it I just found the right levers to pull at the right time. By helping others achieve what they wanted to. The feeling that money didn’t matter, especially when I didn’t have it. 

The most important thing to me was the relationships I had with others, with my family with my friends. I didn’t think about money. I didn’t look at my bank account very much.

My success metrics were how many people could I invite over to my house on a whim? Did other people want to be friends with me? 

**I want to change the person I’ve turned into over this last year.**

### Change

What am I going to do to get to where I would like to be?

-   Going to actually read How to win friends and influence people. I will read 30 minutes every day. From cover to cover.
-   Will keep up with my Todo List. I will look to it as my single source of truth. I will have weekly goals based on it.
-   I will stop watching the news so much.
-   I will use the pomodoro tech. again. I will build in long periods of focus again.
-   I will build something that I’m proud of and open source.
-   I will write again.
-   I will push myself like I used to. Not just go through the motions, but like I want the people next to be my business partner. Like I’d want them to respect the work ethic and know what kind of person I am. Like this is my last day on earth. Frankly, it can be.
-   That everything is within arms reach. If I have a good attitude and prepare anything is possible.
