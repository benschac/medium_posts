Learning, the ability to grasp a new tool, concept or idea and use it is powerful. It’s made life indefinitely better. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that just a couple 100,000 years ago, we were competing with every other living thing on this planet. Now, we rule our domain and might single handily destroy it because of this incredible ability. 

So, it’s been no secret. For a while now I’ve been trying to teach myself how to program. Well, it’s taken me a little more time to get to the point of being hired than I’d like. This is for a lot of different reasons that aren’t really all that relevant to this post. What is relevant is understanding how learning works, what interests you and how to stick with it so you too gain new abilities.

Learning isn’t easy, if everyone could be a superstar natural language processing PhD I’m sure we all would. But, we don’t. A baby takes a while to learn how to walk, or talk or really do anything for that matter. That’s how I’ve started to model my learning. Learn like a baby. Fall, break shit, talk gibberish, try again and again and again. Or, write really ugly code. Look at other peoples code, try and make my code less ugly. Understand what’s going on and maybe make my code a little less ugly, one day.

You’re never going to get it on the first try. No one does. If they do, honestly fuck that guy.

  

Concepts take a while to bake into that thick skull, so don’t get down on yourself if you don’t get it. It’s okay. Be a baby. Fail a lot.

So what have I been doing do get better at learning? Great question!

First I took this course. [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). It’s fantastic. I can’t recommend it enough. Learning is like anything. Playing a sport or an instrument. You should treat it like one. In school we’re often just taught subject matter (that’s often super dry and a waste of time, not going to shit on the common core for the rest of this post, promise). It about learning how to get a grasp of the content and get better at grasping new content and concepts.

There’s a couple of easy things you can do to help push yourself in the right direction.

1.  _Practice makes permanent:_ Think back to babies for a second. They keep practicing. You wouldn’t think a baby couldn’t walk just because it tried to walk a couple hundred times and fell down right? Keep trying. Everyday, especially stuff that you think is flying over your head. You’ll get it after failing enough times.
2.  _Chunk It:_ It’s the opposite of memorizing a fact. Focusing, connecting scattered bits and facts, understanding it’s underlying and main concepts to paint a larger picture. Going back to our first point, practice makes chunks permanent. The more chunks you have the more chunks you have to further build context and become creative with the new knowledge you’ve internalize. It’s like riding a bike, or walking. You, don’t think about either once you have the hang of it. But, they both chunk on a lot of very fine grain motor skills. Build on the building blocks. Complex concepts eventually become second nature. Just chunk it. Think about the connections in the different topics you’re studying to gain a bigger picture of what you’re learning.
3.  _Chill, bruh_: Get sleep, relax. Your brain is complex as shit. It weighs 2.5 to 3 pounds and needs 23% of your bodies daily calories. Something that’s 2 pounds is and roughly 2% of your bodies mass needs 23% of the fuel needed to make it on the day-to-day. That’s the same tool that made civilization possible. The language your reading this post in, the computer it’s on, the network it’s getting the data from. You get the point. There’s also different modes of learning, which chilling is important. Defuse and focused learning.  Think about getting your best idea ever. Where’d you get it? I’m going to guess probably taking a shit or in the shower. When you’re super relaxed. The best way to learn is to go in-between defuse and focused modes. It takes time. You wouldn’t try and deadlift 300 pounds after not going to the gym for a year, right? Same thing here. Move back and forth in-between the two modes. Oh, and come back to the material. Bullet point one!
4.  _Why you procrastinate and how to stop:_ The short and simple answer is we run away from really big challenging tasks to something small and simple. Then, we continue to put it off because it’s easier to stick to something easier or not working. Or procrastinate. Whatever.

The last bit of advice that really helped me out was not getting riled up, mad, angry or just generally frustrated. Yes, this is much easier said than done, I know. It actually works though, I swear.

Having fun with a problem, looking at it as a challenge rather than getting upset makes the problem solving process that much easier.

 We all get stuck. Learning is difficult. Stick with it.
