Javascript is going through I bit of a metamorphosis. Features that we’ve been waiting for years for have finally been introduced to the language. It’s seemed overwhelming at first so I figured if I could write about it and explain it to others it’ll probably better solidify my understanding and help others learn too.

  
This isn’t meant to be an in depth dive dive, but rather just enough to understand why you’d want to use these features, what they do and how to move forward on your own from there.

### Classes

Are syntactic sugar on top of (Objects inheriting objects)  — \[todo lets check the docs and get an exact definition before we publish this.\] OIO constructor functions that have been traditionally used in javascript.

#### the constructor function

```
class Person {
   constructor() {

   }

};
```

### Iterators and Generators

We’ve been able to iterate for a while now in `for` loops and iteration functions like `map` , `reduce` , `filter` etc. It’s nothing new. Now, we have the ability to customize iteration in object's `for of` loops.

  

```
Some code that we'll show how this thing works.
```

  

### Maps

### WeakMaps

Symbols
