[Paul Adler](https://medium.com/u/7485575c431f) is the most gifted musician I know. I spent a lot of time with him during my formative years in high school. If you lived in Millburn, New Jersey during 2001–2010 you knew Paul, or of him.

Paul past away on July 9th, 2019. Reflecting on our time together has opened my eyes to how much we had in common, what I admired about him and for the context of this post what I learned from Paul and how he’s made me a better programmer.

My earliest memories of Paul were in middle school. Paul is a year older than me (and one year younger than my brother).
