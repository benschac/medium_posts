### **tl;dr**

We’re hiring, the job request document is at the end of the article (by design). I just recently got hired and thought about everything I would change about the process. Spoilers, it’s a long laundry list.

### My Email Inbox is Full

Today, 6/2/2018 I received 5 different email requests inquiring for engineering help. They range in quality.

-   _Low Quality:_ Random recruiter spam from LinkedIn. The typical JavaScript/Java ones that assume you know Java if you know JavaScript.
-   _Medium Quality:_ A CEO/CTO/Founder with capital reaching out to you directly via cold DM. This could be through something like Angel.co or LinkedIn DMs.
-   _High Quality:_ People you respect at organizations who have their shit together. Your Boston Consulting Group’s and small startups with impressive high preforming team members who might have some sweet open source code.

We have choice if we want it, usually we have little time and don’t want to talk to someone who doesn’t understand our job function just to talk to someone who does.

### People who know what they’re doing

Get their technical decision maker in touch with me first. Their time is just as important as mine. It’ll make me feel important and save me time. I like feeling important.

### Job Postings Don’t Tell Me Much

I thought, I bet Google has a great job posting, or Amazon, or company x, y or z. They’re all the same. Years, experience, college degree you get the deal. The same person copied that job posting for the last 10 years and just copy pasted some buzzwords. I know because I read them. A lot. It doesn’t tell me much about the work, people, values and expectations of the role. 

### Why This Approach Doesn’t Work

Doesn’t give me insight into how the team thinks. I want to know both personally and professionally I align with these people. I want to tell people I have the best and brightest teammates in the business. We’re basically the ’95 New Jersey Devils. If I want to find my [#Hall4Hart](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/hall-hart-slam-dunk-no-brainer-lavoie/) type performance player I need to tell the world what I’m looking for.
