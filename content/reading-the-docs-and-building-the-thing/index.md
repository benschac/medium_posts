Reading docs is probably some of the least exciting stuff I do on the day to day. Yet, it’s extremely useful and makes my life easier as a whole. Docs are our friends, yet I don’t give them the time of day. I really should.

So, I tried something a little different with [React’s](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) docs. For every feature or concept they threw my way, I built something with it. Yes, this little web application doesn’t really know what it wants to be, but it uses a lot of nifty features from react that I know a lot more about than I did reading the docs the first time around.

Why go this route? I was just trying to build things before without much luck. Either looking at the docs for what I needed or poking around stackoverflow. I also tried a couple of different video courses and play along courses. Nothing substitutes reading about a concept and then figuring a way to build on that concept in the real world. Getting the description and then implementing it has forced me to internalize what’s going on leaps and bounds to what I did before.

A good example is using ES6 class methods with React. There’s a couple of ways to do the same thing. You can either bind the function on the constructor with the this key word or you can use the arrow function. Normally I’d just read over something like that and use whatever the docs used in the code examples. But, being forced to implement it made me actually look into what was going on. Glancing at something is easy. Not getting a funky error, not so much.

Same goes for click handlers or I guess anything else that I learned about. There’s an internal gratification in implementing something in your own way or trying it a little differently. Also, now I have a little timer app that I can totally clean up a bit and put on my resume.
