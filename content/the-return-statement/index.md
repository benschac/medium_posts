Just like that, my three months at [RC](http://recurse.com) are up. It’s incredible how quickly time moves forward. Yes, I know we’ve all heard this before. I’ll skip the crying feels and get to the point.

On the first day the Recurse Center staff tells you one thing. Well they’ll tell you a lot of stuff. But, this is the big one. This is a time and a place where people come to get dramatically better at programming. It doesn’t matter what kind of computer you use, what projects you want to build, your background, age, favorite programing language. It’s as pure and functional as you can get. I’m here because I want to become a better programmer. Everyone around me wants to as well. However you want to get there is your own choice.

Coming into Recurse I had very little experience. I’d been coding away at FreeCodeCamp, building projects and solving algorithm challenges. At work, I even got to make small bug fixes here and there. I felt like I could code a little bit but not at the level of a “real” programmer.

So, here’s where my story changes from the happy feel good zero-to-hero super developer happily ever after. My progress didn’t travel in a straight line. I came in with a few questions and a general sense of direction of where I wanted to be. I left with many more questions and not having a general sense of where I wanted to be. I still consider the experience a success even though I didn’t end up where I think I would.

The most important thing I came to figure out was I didn’t really understand how I learned. How I’d pick up new concepts and most importantly what spooked me out and got me upset along the way. Being a good programmer isn’t just about writing code, it’s about understanding yourself and being able to be aware enough to guide your own course. It’s one thing to be able to solve a hard problem. It’s quite a different thing to realize your able to do it and how + where to get started. That’s where I think I made the largest gains as a programmer.

The second aspect of the experience that was truly life changing was the folks I met along the way. I don’t think I’ve ever met such bright, caring, thoughtful, accepting and just plain fun people in my life. Being apart of this community is something that’ll aways cherish.

My final two cents about the experience is that it taught me a lot about how other folks work. That this isn’t magic. It takes a lot of time and energy to get good at something, especially something like programming. We all get down on ourselves, we all come across seemingly impossible challenges. It’s how you respond to those challenges that gets you to where you want to be. That’ll continue to build on your self-esteem and hopefully get you across the finish line.

Looking through my notebook book I realize I actually did learn a whole bunch even if I don’t feel like I did. Being self-aware is probably the one thing I need to work on the most looking back at this experience. That to me makes this whole thing worth it. Even though I didn’t build the cool projects that I though I would. I finally started to get on the right path to eventually getting there.

Also, I did build a couple of really cool projects.
